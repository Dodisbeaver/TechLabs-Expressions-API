# Api_Expressions
An Api what has more expressions than my thesis one (slutarbete_api).
This is Flask based code and has a SVG data for different expressions.

## Code
This Api has a Docker container, what will automatically download Flask when opening the code in a container.
To run the code, one simply can write: flask run. 

## URL
The plain localhost URL will show text "Hello Flask" in the browser, to show that the applicaion is working.
When writing URL/face/all then one gets all the data that is stored in this API.
To get a secifict expression one has to write after the basic (localhost) URL: face?name=smile. Instead of smile one could use whatever other name that the API data has.
